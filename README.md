## Overview

### What's the problem?

In the current pandemic situation where whole world has adapted social distancing and home lockdown to keep themself safe, We are facing issue in getting daily need items and many services.
Also as schools , college, Gym and many other institues are closed in this situation to avoid any people gathering, We still need to enhance our skills and health which is also the best use of time given by home lockdown.
In this tough situation, People around us (Our community) can help us in many ways however there is no channel to get all information , requests and people in one place to help each other.
To solve this issue and to help people around us , We have created "GoodWill Community App" to help The community by community.

### How can technology help?

Technology can  help in bringing people close virtually and helping in getting all the daily services and items.
An mobile app will using IBM cloud services  and Watson Assistant service can help in resolving many issue and reducing stress in this crsis. It will empower  cooperation in the community 
Creating a chatbot using Watson Assistant can help you address the issues that your users may face while trying to gather the necessary information.

## The idea

The goal is to provide a mobile application for the community to facilitate sharing of goods,support and thought in this tough time .

### Steps

1. [Set up an instance of Watson Assistant](#1-set-up-an-instance-of-watson-assistant).
1. [Provision a CouchDB instance using Cloudant](#2-Provision-a-CouchDB-instance-using-Cloudant).
1. [Generate an API Key from the HERE Developer Portal](#3-generate-an-api-key-from-the-here-developer-portal).
1. [Run the server](#4-run-the-server).
1. [Run the mobile application](#5-run-the-mobile-application).

### 1. Set up an instance of Watson Assistant

Log in to IBM Cloud and provision a Watson Assistant instance.

1. Provision an instance of **Watson Assistant** from the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant).
1. Launch the Watson Assistant service.
1. [Create an **Assistant**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-add).
1. [Add a dialog skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-dialog-add) to the **Assistant** by importing the [`starter-kit-cooperation-dialog-skill.json`](./starter-kit/assistant/starter-kit-cooperation-dialog-skill.json) file.
1. Go back to All Assistants page, open **Settings** from the action menu ( **`⋮`** ) and click on **API Details**.
1. Note the **Assistant ID**, **API Key**, and **Assistant URL**. For **Assistant URL**, make note of the base URL/domain (e.g., `https://api.us-south.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com` or `https://api.eu-gb.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com`) and not the full directory/path. You will need all three of these values in Step 4 below.

1. Go to **Preview Link** to get a link to test and verify the dialog skill.

### 2: Provision a CouchDB instance using Cloudant

Log into the IBM Cloud and provision a [CouchDB instance using Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant).

1. From the catalog, select Databases and then the Cloudant panel.
1. Once selected, you can choose your Cloudant plan -- there is a free tier for simple testing that is sufficient to run this CIR example. You should choose an appropriate region, give the service a name, and it is recommended you choose **Use only IAM** under **Available authentication methods**. You can leave the other settings with their defaults. Click the blue **Create** button when ready.
1. Once your Cloudant instance has been created, you need to create a service credential that the CIR API Server can use to communicate with it. By selecting your running Cloudant instance, you can choose **Service credentials** from the left-hand menu. Create a new service credential and give it a name (it doesn't matter what you call it).
1. Once created, you can display the credentials by selecting **view service credentials**, and then copy the credential, so you are ready to paste it into the code of the API server in Step 4.

### 3. Generate an API Key from the HERE Developer Portal

The application uses HERE Location Services for maps, searching, and routing.

To access these services, you'll need an API key. Follow the instructions outlined in the [HERE Developer Portal](https://developer.here.com/ref/IBM_starterkit_Covid?create=Freemium-Basic) to [generate a JavaScript API key](https://developer.here.com/documentation/authentication/dev_guide/topics/api-key-credentials.html).

### 4. Run the server

To set up and launch the server application:

1. Go to the `starter-kit/server-app` directory of the cloned repo.
1. Edit the  existing  `.env` file and update the `ASSISTANT_URL`, `ASSISTANT_ID`, and `ASSISTANT_IAM_APIKEY` with the values from the dialog skill's API Detail page in Watson Assistant, from Step 1. Also, update the `CLOUDANT_ID` and `CLOUDANT_IAM_APIKEY` with the values from the service credential you created in Step 2. (Note that the `username` from the credential is what should be used for the `CLOUDANT_ID`.)
1. Edit the **name** value in the `manifest.yml` file to your application name (for example, _my-app-name_).
1. From a terminal:
    1. Go to the `starter-kit/server-app` directory of the cloned repo.
    1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
    1. Launch the server application locally or deploy to IBM Cloud:
        - To run locally:
            1. Start the application: `npm start`.
            1. The server can be accessed at <http://localhost:3000>.
        - To deploy to IBM Cloud:
            1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account using the IBM Cloud CLI: `ibmcloud login`.
            1. Target a Cloud Foundry org and space: `ibmcloud target --cf`.
            1. Push the app to IBM Cloud: `ibmcloud app push`.
            1. The server can be accessed at a URL using the **name** given in the `manifest.yml` file (for example,  <https://my-app-name.bluemix.net>).

### 5. Run the mobile application

To run the mobile application (using the Xcode iOS Simulator or Android Studio Emulator):

1. Go to the `starter-kit/mobile-app` directory of the cloned repo.

1. Edit the  existing  `.env` file:
    - Update the `STARTER_KIT_SERVER_URL` with the URL to the server app launched in the previous step.
        > **Note**: If you are running the server locally and testing with the Android Emulator set the `STARTER_KIT_SERVER_URL` using the local machine's URL (e.g., `http://10.0.2.2:3000`) instead of `localhost`
    - Update the `HERE_APIKEY` with the API key generated in the HERE Developer Portal.
1. From a terminal:
    1. Go to the `starter-kit/mobile-app` directory.
    1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
    1. **iOS only**: Go to the `ios` directory: `cd ios`.
    1. **iOS only**: Install pod dependencies: `pod install`.
    1. **iOS only**: Return to the `mobile-app` directory: `cd ../`.
    1. Launch the app in the simulator/emulator: 
        - **iOS only**: `npm run ios`
            > **Note**: You should be running at least iOS 13.0. The first time you launch the simulator, you should ensure that you set a Location in the Features menu.
        - **Android only**: `npm run android`
            > **Note**: Your Android Studio needs to have the `Android 9 (Pie)` SDK and a `Pie API Level 28` virtual device

With the application running in the simulator/emulator, you should be able to navigate through the various screens:
